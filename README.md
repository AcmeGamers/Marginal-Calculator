# Work In Progress

## Marginal-Calculator

To calculate values like PED, YED, XED, and percental change. I know the code is kind of hard to understand at the moment, I will refactor and make it easier to understand once I'm done with the whole calculator, currently I'm just speedrunning the whole thing due to less availability of time.
