PED, YED, XED

# Part 1
## Finding Q1
q1 = expression (putting p1, p2, p3, y)
q1 = answer


# Part 2
## Finding PED
ped = dq1/dp1 x p1/q1

## Finding Derivative
dQ1/dP1 = d/dP1 (expression) # All values other than p1 are constant
dq1/dp1 = answer

so putting derivate in ped

ped = derivate x p1/q1


## Part 3
## Finding cross price

good 1 and good 2 = dq1 / dp2 x p2/q1

### Finding Derivative
dq1/dp2 = d/dp2 (expression) # All values other than p2 are constant
dq1/dp2 = answer

XED = derivative x p2/q1


## Part 4
## Finding cross price
good 1 and good 3 = dq1 / dp2 x p2/q1

### Finding Derivative
dq1/dp2 = d/dp2 (expression) # All values other than p2 are constant
dq1/dp2 = answer

XED = derivative x p2/q1


Part 5

Percentage Change
PED for good 1 and good 3, decrease by 5% in price of goods 3

cross ped good 1 and good 3 = -0.08  // Taken from Part 4, cross price of good 1 and good 3
xed = % change in q1 / % change in p1   // Since change in goods 3 and goods 1 price is decrease by 5%, it is -5

so 
% change in q1 = percent change x cross price
